/**
 * Getting the sealed entries onto the chain without anybody asking.
 *
 * The service already held every scorecard, every ballot and the tree they
 * build; what it did not do was act. `POST /seal` had to be called by hand and
 * nothing at all revealed the entries afterwards, so a hackathon judged
 * perfectly well arrived at its ranking with no scores on chain to rank.
 *
 * Three moments, and the contract decides all of them:
 *
 *   Judging, once the window shuts   publish the root that commits to the set
 *   Reveal                           open every entry under that root
 *   Reveal, once they are all open   rank, since nothing is left to wait for
 *
 * Nothing here is a decision either. The root is a pure function of the entries
 * held, the reveals are authorized by their proofs rather than by this service,
 * and a contract that is not ready refuses the call. The only thing this adds
 * is being awake, the same as the clock.
 *
 * It is separate from the clock because of what it holds. Sealed entries live
 * behind a wall no client role can reach, and the process on the other side of
 * that wall is this one; moving the work to a service that has to be handed the
 * scorecards to do it would put them somewhere new for no gain.
