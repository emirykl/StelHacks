/**
 * The clock.
 *
 * A Soroban contract cannot wake itself up. It knows its own deadlines, its own
 * safety window and whether it still owes anybody money, and it will refuse
 * every one of the calls below until the moment is right — but nothing in the
 * ledger schedules a call, so a condition that has been met stays unacted on
 * until somebody sends a transaction. Without this service that somebody was
 * the organizer, looking at a row of buttons whose only honest caption was
 * "yes, the contract is right".
 *
 * So this is not an automation of a decision. There is no decision in any of
 * them: each condition is something anybody can read off the chain, each call
 * takes no signature, and the contract refuses it early no matter who sends it.
 * All this process contributes is being awake.
 *
 *   clock                            keep every hackathon to its own clock
 *   clock <contract id>              keep one, including one we hold no row for
 *   clock --once                     one lap, then stop
 *
 * Which means losing it is a degradation and not a corruption. Deadlines are
 * still enforced while it is down, because entries and scores are refused by
 * their own timestamps rather than by the phase, and no money can move anywhere
 * it was not already owed. What stops is the handing over: a stage that has
 * ended does not open the next one, payouts do not open when the safety window
 * expires, and an event whose vault is empty is not marked finished.

/**
 * One hackathon, when somebody names one.
 *
 * The same argument the indexer takes, and for the same reason: the list comes
 * from the `hackathons` table, so an instance deployed outside the product —
 * which is every instance a test script stands up — is invisible to a service
 * that only reads that table. Naming it is how the pair can be pointed at a run
 * that nobody wrote a row for.
