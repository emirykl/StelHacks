/**
 * One hackathon, as somebody deciding between several of them reads it.
 *
 * The banner runs across the top in its own proportions rather than down one
 * side. A banner is a wide image by nature, and standing one on its end means
 * cropping away most of what was drawn; keeping the shape it was made in also
 * leaves the card narrow enough that three sit side by side, which is the
 * number somebody actually compares at once.
 *
 * The card speaks in both voices, which is the point rather than a compromise.
 * The name and the tagline are a person's. The stage, the countdown and the
 * prize are the chain's, and they are set in the chain's type so a reader can
 * see at a glance which half of the card they could go and check themselves.
 *
 * Its edges are drawn on all four sides. Earlier these cards were separated by
 * the grid's own gaps showing through, which reads as a table when the rows are
 * even and as nothing at all when they are not.
