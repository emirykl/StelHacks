  /* A sheet of glass across the top, curled off at the bottom two corners.

     It floated for a while: held off all four edges, hairlined the whole way
     round, four corners rounded. That shape is a card, and a card announces
     itself. What belongs up here is a surface the page passes behind, so the
     bar goes back to meeting the top and the sides, and the only drawn edge
     left is the one that has a job — the line the content stops at.

     That line is barely there on purpose. The bar is read as glass because
     the page is visible through it and blurred, not because an outline says
     where it ends; an edge you can see the weight of is the thing that turns
     glass back into a panel. The two bottom corners carry all the shape. */

        leave the page sharp in the notches beside them. This reaches lower
        than the bar and fades out rather than stopping on a line, so what is
        under the curls is blurred like everything above them and the corner
        reads as a shape cut in glass rather than a bite taken out of it.

        It sits under the header and over the page, and it takes no pointer
        events: it is a surface, not a control.
