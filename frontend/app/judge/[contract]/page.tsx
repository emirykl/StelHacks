 * The judge's one visit.
 *
 * Keyed on the contract rather than on a name, for the same reason the
 * organizer's console is: a judge is given an address by the organizer, and
 * making them wait for our indexer to have caught up before they can score is
 * the wrong thing to make anybody wait for.
 *
 * Laid out as the organizer's panel is, because it is the same kind of room: a
 * desk somebody was sent to with a job on it. It used to open with a display
 * heading that said "Score" and a hatched band under it, which is the language
 * the marketing pages use to introduce the product to somebody who has not
 * decided yet. A judge has decided.
