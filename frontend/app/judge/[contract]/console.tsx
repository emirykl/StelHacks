 * Scoring, in one sitting and at no cost to the judge.
 *
 * A card is signed in the wallet and handed to the collection service, which
 * publishes only a root until the reveal. That service is the one place in this
 * product carrying real trust, and the two things that bound it are both on
 * this page: the signature, so it cannot invent a card, and the receipt, so it
 * cannot quietly drop one.
 *
 * The receipt is the judge's, not ours, and it is what they produce if their
 * card turns out to be missing from the tree. It is kept whole and kept folded:
 * the screen after sealing answers whether the card went in, and the proof is a
 * word away for the day somebody needs it.
