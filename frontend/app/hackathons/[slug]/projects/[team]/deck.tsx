/**
 * A deck, read the way a deck is read: one page at a time, going right.
 *
 * The browser's own PDF viewer was doing this before and it is built for a
 * document rather than a presentation. It scrolls, so a fifteen slide deck in a
 * short frame becomes a thin column somebody drags through, and half of every
 * slide is cut off at any moment. It also brings its own toolbar, its own
 * scrollbar and its own idea of what the page is worth zooming to, none of
 * which can be styled and all of which can be turned off in Chrome and not in
 * Firefox.
 *
 * So the pages are drawn here, onto a canvas, and the frame is ours. Forward
 * and back are two buttons, the arrow keys and the scroll wheel; the wheel
 * works because the page is a canvas in this document rather than a viewer in
 * somebody else's, which is the whole reason for the change.
 *
 * pdf.js is loaded on demand and only once a deck is on the page. It is the
 * largest thing this product would ship and most readers never open a project.
