/**
 * Everything about a project that the chain does not hold.
 *
 * The contract stores a digest and a link. The title, the write up, the
 * artwork and the other links live here, and none of them decide anything: the
 * ranking is computed from scorecards against a rubric that was frozen before
 * any of this was typed.
 *
 * Written through a route rather than straight from the browser for the same
 * reason team names are. Row level security asks `team_members`, which the
 * indexer fills from chain events, so a team that submitted a minute ago is not
 * yet a team as far as the database is concerned and the write is refused. The
 * contract knew the moment the transaction landed, so the contract is asked.
