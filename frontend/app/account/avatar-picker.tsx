/**
 * The picture, changed where it is shown.
 *
 * It was a field in the form below with a button beside it reading "Change",
 * which is a control describing itself in a place nobody was looking. The
 * portrait at the top of the page is where somebody looks when they want to
 * change their picture, so that is where the control goes: the pencil says the
 * thing the button said, and it says it on the object it applies to.
 *
 * It saves on choosing rather than waiting for the form. A picture is not part
 * of the sentence the rest of that form writes — nothing else on the page has
 * to be valid for this one to be true — and a portrait that changed on screen
 * but only really changed after somebody scrolled down and pressed Save would
 * be lying for as long as it took them to find out.
